I am focused on information technology more than just software development at the moment. Regardless, whatever I will publish whatever contributions I have from personal projects or hobbies.

I am specialized in computer networking, Kubernetes, the VMware vSphere suite, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I also program often in C, Java, or Python depending on which tool is able to get the job done right.
